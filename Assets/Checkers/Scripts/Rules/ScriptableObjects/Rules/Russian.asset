  Info: "This is Russian checkers.\nIt is played on an 8\xD78 chequered board with
    12 pieces per side. The simple checkers can move and capture forward and backward. 
    If a player's piece moves into the kings row on the opposing player's side of
    the board, that piece is to be \"crowned\", becoming a \"king\" and gaining the
    ability to move backwards as well as forwards and to choose on which free square
    on this diagonal to stop. If a man touches the kings row during a capture and
    can continue a capture, it jumps backwards as a king. The player can choose where
    to land after the capture."
