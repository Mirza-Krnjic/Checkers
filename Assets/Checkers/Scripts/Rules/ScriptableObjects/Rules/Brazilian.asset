  Info: "This is Brazilian checkers.\nIt is played on an 8\xD78 chequered board with
    12 pieces per side. The simple checkers can move and capture forward and backward.
    A piece is crowned if it stops on the far edge of the board at the end of its
    turn (that is, not if it reaches the edge but must then jump another piece backward).
    Another piece is placed on top of it to mark it. Crown checkers can move freely
    multiple steps in any direction and may jump over and hence capture an opponent
    piece some distance away and choose where to stop afterwards, but must still
    capture the maximum number of pieces possible. Requirement that the maximum number
    of checkers be captured whenever a player has capturing options."
